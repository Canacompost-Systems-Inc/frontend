# Getting Started 
1. Install Node version 16 - https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm i -D concurrently wait-on` to install concurrently, which we need to run Electron.
4. `npm run dev` to run the application in its own window.
5. `npm start` to run the app in a browser. This will live update the client as you make code changes.
